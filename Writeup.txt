# Advanced Lane Lines
The goal of this project was to implement an algorithm that can detect lane lines with different colors (yellow and white) under different lighting conditions (i.e. shadows) and road qualities. The intention was to improve the detection qualitiy of the very first project of this course.

## The Pipeline
The pipeline from an input image to the output image with the drawn lane on it is as follows:
- Camera calibration (only once)
- Undistortion
- Filtering by gradient, saturation and lightness
- Perspective transformation
- Finding lines with sliding window method
- Fitting polynomials to the lines
- Drawing the lane on the undistorted image

##### 1. Camera calibration
All lenses inflict distortions to images, thus the first step is to find the camera parameters in order to undistort the images. Therefore, several images of chessboard patterns are used, OpenCV can then create the camera matrix by providing the "real world" points for each image. OpenCV detects the corresponding images points automatically. This procedure has to be done only once, the parameters can be used for all further images.

##### 2. Filtering
In order to find the lines the images have to be filtered by several ciriteria. The first filter uses the Sobel operator in order to compute the gradients between the pixels, effectively finding edges within the image. The second and third filter are using color attributes. Therefore, the image gets converted from the usual RGB color space to the HLS color space, HLS tries to represent the colors more like the human eye recognizes them, making it a better choice than RGB for color detection matters. The saturation, as well as the lightness channel are being used to detect the colors yellow and white within the image. For a better detection in dark spots (i.e. shadows from trees) the S-channel gets multiplied by a certain value. The downside is that, for example, the sky now also gets deteced by the filter. The good thing is that only the lower half of the image will be used for the line detection.
